## Express Typescript Example

A simple express api using typescript

### Getting started

First of all you need to install all the dependencies that the project needs to run, for that run the command below:

```bash
yarn install
```

Feel free to use npm too, I'm putting yarn here because it was the package manager I used when developing the project.

Now the command below is for you to run the project under development:

```bash
yarn run dev
```

it is necessary to set an `.env` file that will contain the **PORT** variable that the service will use, if not set it will run on `3333`.

And to finish the command so you can build the application and convert everything to javascript is the command below:

```bash
yarn run build
```
